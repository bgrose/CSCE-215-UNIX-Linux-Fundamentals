What does it do:
First, the code will set ptr[0] to a and ptr[1] to b
THen it will set ptr[2] to c, as it is first value in array, then it will print out the full original ray.
Then it will change ptr[0] to z and ptr[1] to y
However, because the variabkes in those spots point to that of ch1 and ch2, the values of ch1 and 2 are changed to z and y as well
